The Deaf unemployment rate in the United States is a staggering 265% higher than hearing peer unemployment, and Gunderson strives to change this number by connecting and empowering the Deaf community through her company.

      <p style ="font-size:23px;">Dell is among the people who believe that social or physical circumstance should not impede use of the internet . Among many other inspiring projects, Dell works to create social media platforms for Blind people in India who may not have all the opportunities as others.
